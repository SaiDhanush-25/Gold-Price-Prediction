 Project Overview

 
This project uses the Random Forest Regression algorithm to predict gold prices based on historical data. The model is trained on various economic indicators and market trends to provide accurate price forecasts.

🔍 Dataset


Source: Kaggle.com

Features: Includes date, gold price, market index values, currency exchange rates, etc.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and train-test split.

Algorithm: Random Forest Regression


Why Random Forest?
*Handles non-linear relationships well
*Reduces overfitting compared to decision trees
*Provides feature importance scores.


Evaluation Metrics:
*Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
*Mean Squared Error (MSE)
*R² Score
